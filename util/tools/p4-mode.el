;; Given two different versions of P4 language, P4_14 and P4_16 I decided to
;; split P4 mode into two separate ones: P4_14 and P4_16
;;
;; This file therefore will load both modes and then the user can choose them
;; by using Emacs mode line. Unfortunately, at least for now, P4 programs have
;; the same extension (.p4) regardless of the version of the language. I would
;; recommend associating this extension with the mode you use most, while
;; getting into the habit of starting .p4 files with the mode line, e.g.
;;
;; /* -*- mode: P4_16 -*- */

(load "p4_14-mode")
(load "p4_16-mode")
